# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for a Manufacturing Industry

This is my Master Thesis at University of Turin.

## Abstract
Anomaly Detection is an increasingly important topic, and its use ranges from the medical field to the financial field via more standard approaches such as the analysis of sensors installed on instruments or machinery. The task it solves is to identify events or observations that are rare or deviate significantly from the majority of data and do not fit a definition of normal behavior. Looking for these anomalies can be useful when statistical methods are to be applied and a data cleanup is necessary, but not only that. In many applications, anomalies are of high interest because they may contain important information and therefore need attention. Anomaly Detection methods are divided into Supervised, Semi-Supervised or Unsupervised and a large number of them have been proposed in the literature but there is no method that is the most accurate for every dataset. Moreover, the availability of anomaly labels for a certain dataset is usually low or completely absent in practice. The objective of this thesis is to apply Unsupervised Anomaly Detection methods within the Beat 4.0 project carried out by SKF and ALTEN ITALY. Following an introduction on the context in which it operates, the problems and the main techniques proposed in the literature, a Model Selection algorithm will be shown that goes to answer the following question: given a dataset without labels and a set of Anomaly Detectors, how to be able to select the most accurate model? For this purpose, three classes of unsupervised metrics called Model Centrality, Clustering Coefficient, and Performance on Injected Synthetic Anomalies are defined and it is shown how they are correlated with respect to the supervised metric F1-Score. Several Rank Aggregation methods will also be proposed: Borda, Robust Borda, AVG Score, and Kemeny-Young used to combine the three unsupervised metrics, and an in-depth analysis on the performance of each against benchmark datasets from ODDS and SMD.
